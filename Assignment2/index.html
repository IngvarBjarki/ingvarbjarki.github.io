            <h4>Description</h4>
            <p>The graph above shows the number of prostitution
                instances in San Francisco, plotted against the
                number of vehicle theft instances in the same city.
                The points on the graph each represent a district within
                 the city. The size of the points are proportional to the
                 number of crimes within the district.
                 Click the <span style="color:rgb(100,161,159)" ><strong>green</strong></span> button to toggle between the years
                  2003 and 2015 to see how the crime frequency
                   changes between these years.</p>

            <h4> Explain in your own words why you think I want the axes to be the same for both years? </h4>
             <p>If the axes would change depending on the maximum x- and y-values for each of the years, the distance that the points travel when you toggle between years would not be representative of the change in crime frequency. The visualization could then be misleading in terms of represting the change in crime frequency between the two years.</p>

        <h4>Description</h4>
        <p> The graph above shows k-means clustering for
         prostitution instances in San Francisco.
         The points are displayed in different colors
          depending on what cluster they are assigned to.
          Select the number means k by clicking on one of the
           <span style="color:rgb(100,161,159)" ><strong>green</strong></span> buttons. A new graph should load within a
           second or two.
        </p>

        <h4>Why is the size of the file important?</h4>
        <p>the data used to
            plot the K-means have to include both longitude
             and latitude cordinates for each of the points on the
              graph. The points on this graph are somewhat
              transparent. They form large clusters and are plotted
               on top of one another so it may be hard to see how
               many points there actually are on the graph.
               Every time a new number of Kâ€˜s is chosen one
                of the files needs to be read and processes again.
                Needless to say, the size of the file will impact the
                speed of that process. The individual size of all of the
            datafiles used for the K-means plot are 650 KB.</p>
